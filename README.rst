DevOps: To Break Down Organizational Silos
====

What is DevOps? DevOps is a term for a cluster of concepts that has become a movement, “a cross-disciplinary practice dedicated to the study of building, evolving and operating, rapidly-changing resilient systems at scale.” (Jez Humble) The definition of DevOps is not agreed upon by everyone because of the complex processes attached to the term, however, the benefits to teams are universally agreed upon. DevOps empowers organizations, allowing formerly siloed roles or departments to collaborate and produce stronger solutions.  
Benefits of DevOps  

The benefits can be divided into three categories: 

    Technical – A software DEVelopment and IT OPErations team uses continuous delivery to reduce complexity and quickly resolve IT incidents. 
    Culture – DevOps emphasizes collaboration, which results in bolstered employee engagement and happier, more productive employees.
    Business – Thanks to DevOps, an organization can maintain consistent service levels, leading to improved customer satisfaction, reduced incident management costs, and increased ROI.

Automation  
=====

Lean 
====
Failures are just steps to success, and that is what DevOps is all about. Implementing a “lean” DevOps system means accepting failure as a part of the systematic approach to improving everyday operations.  

Measurement  
====
DevOps only yields an ROI when there are standard metrics to track team success. Using the right metrics, a development” and “operations team can understand its strengths and weaknesses, to build actionable paths to address failures.    

Some of the key metrics DevOps teams monitor:  

    Change Lead Time 
    Customer Ticket Volume 
    Deployment Frequency 
    Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) 
    Performance

Sharing 
====

Data silos are an obsolete idea. development” and “operations teams, on the modern hand, operate with open information sharing that makes it simple for team members to stay up to date on important issues. development” and “operations teams consistently share information to keep team members informed about all aspects of an incident from detection to resolution.
